some poems written during the winter of 2024-2025. 

<i>Like casting stones</i> 

Like casting stones 

Things move 

At their proper pace 

Charging money for zines 

Do I recognize you 

Or am I forgetting 

Writing in ink I can’t see 

<br>
<i>Watching Anime</i>


I roll out of bed at noon

Try to make tacos, but the damp tortilla folds into the flame

I drink my coffee 

Supine on the couch 

Karama tucks the death plant seed 

Into his open wound

It blooms 

His body

Collapses in growth and decay

Vines that cling 

To the edifice 

Of a hallowed building 

How many gardens will grow 

From my cuts and scrapes?

What flowers will erupt 

From the kitchen knife confusion

As I slice an avocado 

For my dinner alone

<i>Before The Honored World</i>


Not all seek blessings

Not all seek wisdom 

Lovers fade 

Into the pastel garden 

“Why are you going to the Met?”

“It’s fun?”

I can’t speak 

Without the shadow of potential. 

Lesions on the arched back 

Of the stained marble mare.

Not all run for speed

Not all look for beauty 

I forget that my eyes are weak muscles 

Strained by flashing lights and dully fantasy.

I’ll leave before finding the temple

Not all seek a destination.

<i>Wisdom Teeth</i>


I know enough

To know 

What I do not know 


My students 

Know enough

To think they know

Everything they need

To live a life

That’s unknown 

My students 

Don’t know 

That my heart breaks

When I hear the distance 

Between naive optimism 

And fascist pessimism 


And so I lie 

Disguise my advice

As faith 

In the sacred fragment 

Of the story 

Of their life

<br>
<i>Bar 169</i>


Sometimes, I’m fun.

Sometimes, I’m not.

That’s ok. 

I try to remember what brought me here with E. Beyond the cheap beer, I always felt a frenetic energy, a way in which our conversations spiraled out from each beer and shot. I remember one time I brought F; the three of us drank and drank and drank. Maybe that’s part of why some friendships no longer work. 

Those were chaotic, but affirming moments for me. In the slippage past sobriety, where that uninhibited flow led to delusions of grandeur, aging writers, relationships that didn’t quite fit but we each held on to the possibility of enduring love–somewhere between whining and yearning, spread across every stop and start, I felt us fumble toward an understanding, a friendship. 

But there were always worse hangovers, irritated intestines, and snoozes on the train. Less the flaming out of youth, more the implosion of self. A flailing rather than a splashing about. 

Passion v. stability, another drink v. the hangover, emotional tumult v. the simple life, a complacent self-protection reflected in the empty cup.

On the rooftop 

I want to watch 

The towers tilt 

As the cracked light 

Spits out

A crooked line

I want to watch 

The skyscrapers bend

But from this rooftop

This party

All I find are the arrows 

Becoming fractured asterisks 

From the clenched jaw 

Of erect titans 

That fail to fall

<i>Valentine’s Day</i>


In the green blonde speckle 

Of the misheard turn of phrase

Where I snaked past

Breath unfurling along

The railing that stretched past 

My exasperated feet 

Falling to the street that kept running and running away 


In the orange gold glisten 

Of a face peeled off

The unexamined impasse 

That dripples b/w

Some codes remembered

And newfound locks 

How do the shapes 

Bend into the same 

Marbled curves 

That used to cradle 

An unremembered name


In the walk from Hester 

Past the goth McDonalds 

On the way to the vegan dim sum

But not quite 

It is the fragment 

Of a step 

A forced remembrance 

<br>

I felt each mechanic’s visit 

Roadside rescue

Outstretched hand to a stranger 

Of suspect origin 

How does a film blend the banal emotional intensity of a failing road trip romance with the narrative thrust of unrealized desire? 

A good documentary is about the conditions of truth. It stands between the disorganized everyday and the soft focus of authorship. 

I read that the filmmaker views her art as the aestheticization of oversharing. There’s an intense vulnerability in having a camera strewn about in a cramped, broken down car. The vantage intrudes in the sullen silence, half-finished arguments, and unremembered proposals. 
<br>
I want to make a movie that’s between fiction and documentary, unsure of what is being presented as truth versus what is being constructed as artifice, an after-image of real fantasy.
